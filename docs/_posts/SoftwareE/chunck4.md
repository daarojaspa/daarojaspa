# how money works

Since 1971  under richard nixon republican period dolar stop having an amount of gold  standing behind  it .From that year all around
the word money stoped being something with a material meanning and started  to be the reflect of the trust in asystem of goverment and 
private entitys (national and private banks between them but not the only ones) where national banks can decide to create more
money papers or bills (dollars, euros,pesos )

## what is proff of work
### what is an algorithm
Is just a list of instructions that left no room for abiguitity. the languaje or structures  that alows you to  do a set of instructions
like this so a pc can interpret them  are normally known as a programming language
## what and why is a block

### what is a hash

### what is a bitcoin

the poppularisation fo this tecnologies and the masification of the use of LLms based aplications like chat gpt, added with the 
necesity of les battery comsumption  hace made necesary changes in the  chips architectures becoming more popular what is known 
as system on a chip, this is te integration on a sigle chip of  the CPU, TPU, GPU, NPU, wiffi adapter, barometters, termometers, etc.
i know i know in these series we just have cover a cople of UÂ´s so lets review.

## CPU
the most cummon  processing unit , process things in series and change between processes to give a sensation of paralelism
intel, amd snap dragon M1 from apple every operation accurs in what is cal a cicle  that is control via a litle cristal inside de pc
a 2.1Mghz means 2.1 milion of cicles by second, an operation the smallest one needs  4 cycles (just save  a little
 something like a number in memory. a click or writting a letter is a compilation of this small operations).

## TPU

Tensor processing unit is a chip to do  tensor math where tensor is a special kind of number array like a matrix but
 with more than 2 demensions using  8 bit arithmetics to be presice and anergi saving, its specially use for neural 
networks was invented by google and  and has its own low level programing language name cuda. imagine it like
a monk that only do linear algebra.

## GPU

uses parallelism in processing not only emulates it like a cpu wold do, were developt specially because of the gamming
industry. they usually have their own  ram memory  call VRAm and their own cooling system. we still use CPUs because GPUs are 
Awfull with general tasks. imagine cpu as a manager great with multitasking (wich is actually changing your focus between tasks
fast and easy ) and GPU a painter that is great at it but nothing else, and has abunch of arms to use.

## NPU

Neural procesing unit, is normally envev in cellphones they are use to do voice recognizion, face recognicion  and image 
recognition with out having to connect to a  neural network in the internet
